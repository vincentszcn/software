First Release



Start using the IECookiesView utility
=====================================

This utility is a standalone executable, and it doesn't require any
installation process or additional DLLs. In order to start using it,
simply run the executable (iecv.exe) from any folder you want. If you
have a network, you can put the executable on the server, allowing all
the workstations on the network to use this utility... And remember: No
additional DLLs are required. As long as you have Internet Explorer
(Version 4.0 and above) on your computer, it'll work !

If you want to create a shortcut to IECookiesView utility or to add a
cookies button to Internet Explorer toolbar, you can easily do it by
selecting the "Installation Options" option from the File menu.

If you have a previous version of IECookiesView, you can just overwrite
the previous executable (iecv.exe), and start using the new one.



Uninstall IECookiesView
=======================

The IECookiesView utility doesn't provide an uninstall module, but in
most cases, you can remove it from your computer simply by deleting the
files of IECookiesView (iecv.exe and iecv.chm). However, if you added a
cookies icon into the toolbar of Internet Explorer (by using the
"Installation Options" or /inst command-line option), you should remove
it before you delete the IECookiesView utility.
There are 3 different ways to remove the cookies icon from the toolbar of
Internet Explorer: (You have to use only one of them)
* In the 'File' menu, select "Installation Options", verify that all 3
  options are unchecked, and press the 'Ok' button.
* Run IECookiesView with /uninst command-line option (iecv.exe /uninst)
* In Internet Explorer application: Right-click on the main toolbar of
  Internet Explorer, and from the popup menu, select "Customize". In the
  "Customize Toolbar" window, remove the cookies icon from list of
  toolbar buttons.

The first and the second options also remove the shortcuts to
IECookiesView in the desktop and in the start-menu.



The main window
===============

The main window of IECookiesView contains two sub-windows: The top
sub-window displays the list of all cookies files and their details. When
you select (highlight) a cookies file in the top sub-window, its cookies
are shown in the bottom sub-window. Each cookies file has at least one
cookie line in the bottom sub-window, unless it's deleted or corrupted.
You can increase and decrease the size of both windows by dragging the
splitter to the right direction.

The top sub-window
==================

The top sub-window displays the details of each cookies file in 11
different columns.
You can add, remove, or change the location of a column, by using the
"Choose columns" option in the View menu.
The following table provides basic information about each available
column:



Web site
The Web site that use this cookies file.

Hits
Number of times that the cookies file was accessed by the Web site. This
value is increased by one in each time that the Web site receives
information from the cookies file.

Accessed Date
The last time that the cookies file was accessed by the Web site.

Modified Date
The last time that the cookies file was modified by the Web site.

Created Date
The time that the cookies file was originally created.

Size
The size of the cookies file (in bytes)

User
The logged-on user that accepted the cookie. For this column, there is a
different between Windows 95/98/ME and Windows NT/2000/XP:

* In Windows NT/2000/XP: Each user has a separated cookies folder, so
  the value in this column is always identical for all cookies.
* In Windows 95/98/ME: Unless you explicitly create new user profiles,
  all users share the same cookies folder (in c:\windows\cookies), and
  thus you can watch the cookies of all users on the system.


Filename
the filename of this cookie in the cookies folder.

Status
The status of the cookies file. It can be one of the following statuses:
* Active: The cookies file is active.
* Deleted: The cookies file was deleted. Deleted cookies files will be
  shown only if "Deleted Cookies Files" in the View menu is checked.
* Duplicate: The record is a duplicate reference to the same cookies
  file. Duplicate references in the cookies index file are shown only if
  "Duplicate Records" in the View menu is checked.


Ad
This column can help to identify unwanted advertising related cookies.
This column can contain one of the following values:
* Yes: The cookie file was created by a known advertising Web site.
  IECookiesView uses the domains list in ads.txt for identifying the
  advertising related cookies.
* Suspect: The Web site that created this cookie file is possibly
  related to advertising. IECookiesView identifies suspect Web sites by
  parsing the URL of the Web site.
* Unknown: IECookiesView cannot determine whether the cookie file was
  created by an advertising Web site.


Domain
In many cases, one Web site might create cookies with different host
names. For example: yahoo.com might send you cookies with the following
host names: groups.yahoo.com, local.yahoo.com, store.yahoo.com and more...
This column displays the domain name of the Web site, by extracting it
from the Web site name. If you sort the cookies list by this column, you
can easily view all cookies of a specific Web site (e.g.: All cookies
files of yahoo.com will be displayed in one chunk)


Record Number
Displays the record number inside the cookies index file (index.dat)

When you click on a column header, the cookies files list is sorted by
the clicked column. A second click sorts the column in descending order.



The bottom sub-window
=====================

The bottom sub-window displays the details of the highlighted cookies
file in 6 different columns:



Key
The name of the cookie

Value
The value of the cookie

Domain
The domain name. It usually the same as the Web site in the top
sub-window.

Secure
Specifies whether the cookie is secure.

Expiration Date
the expiration date of the cookie.

Modified Date
The last time that the cookie was modified by the Web site.

Created In
Specifies where the cookie was created:
* Server: The cookie was sent to the client by the Web Server.
* Client: The cookie was created in the client (Internet Explorer) by
  using JavaScript or VBScript.


When you click on a column header, the cookies list is sorted by the
clicked column. A second click sorts the column in descending order.
Each line in the bottom sub-window contains an icon that indicates
whether the cookie is expired or not. If a cookie is expired, a red icon
will be displayed. otherwise, a green icon will be displayed. The
expiration status is determined by comparing the expiration date of the
cookie with the current local time of your computer. When a cookie is
expired (red icon), the Web site cannot use it anymore, unless it sends a
new cookie, with a new expiration date.

    deleted cookies file is remained in the cookies index file
    (index.dat). If this menu item is checked, the deleted cookies files
    are listed in the top sub-window.
  o Duplicate Records: In some circumstances, duplicate references to
    the same cookies file are created in the cookies index file

    Notice:
    - When you select this option, the other view options ("Deleted
      cookies Files" and "Duplicate Records") are automatically disabled.
      i.e.: IECookiesView cannot display the obsolete cookies, together
      with duplicate records or with deleted cookies Files.
    - Some details of the obsolete cookie files are not shown as in
      regular cookie files, because the information is usually extracted
      from the cookies index file.
      Also, the Web site name of obsolete cookie files is usually
      truncated or corrupted.
    - This option might slow the cookies loading process,
      especially in Windows 95/98.

    is detected. If a Web site sends you a new cookie while this menu

  only in the next time that you'll open a new window of Internet
  Explorer. You won't see the change in the current opened Internet
  Explorer windows.

Properties" window.
The "Cookie Properties" windows displays all information about the
cookie, and 2 additional special fields:

  cookie value. For example: If the value is
  50.60.70.80.738234783.472348237, the IP address is 50.60.70.80
  If IECookiesView recognizes the IP address in the cookie value, it'll
  be shown in IP address field. Otherwise, this field will be remained
  empty.

Selecting cookies of specific domains or Web sites
==================================================

If you want to handle together all cookies created by specific Web sites
or domains, you can use the "Select By Domain or Web Site" option from
the Edit menu.


You can select multiple domains at once, as shown in the above
screenshot. After you press the "Ok" button, all cookies of the desired
domains/sites are automatically selected. If you want to see all the
selected sites in one chunk, check the "Sort by selection" check-box.



Saving and loading selections of cookies
========================================

IECookiesView allows you to save the list of current selected cookies
into a file, and then load the cookies selections again when you need it.
In order to save the list of current selected cookies, use the "Save
Current Selections" in the File menu. In order to load back the cookies
selections, use the "Load Selections File" in the File menu.
Starting from version 1.60, IECookiesView automatically saves you last
cookies selection, and loads it each time that you run IECookiesView. The
selections file is saved as 'cookies.ivs' under your cookies folder. If
you don't want that your cookies selections will be saved automatically,
you can simply uncheck the 'Automatically Save Selections' under the View
menu.



Marked cookies
==============

Each time you run IECookiesView, the cookies that has been modified and
accessed since the last run, are marked in yellow and green colors. The
latest accessed cookies are marked with yellow color, and the latest
modified/created cookies are marked with green color. You can clear all
current marks by selecting the "Reset All Marks" item from the View menu.
After you reset the marks, If cookies are modified or accessed again,
they will be marked accordingly. If you want to totally stop the cookies
marking, uncheck the "Mark Modified Cookies" and the "Mark Accessed
Cookies" items in the View Menu.



Deleting and destroying cookies
===============================

IECookiesView provides 2 methods to delete your cookies:
1. Delete Cookies Files: When you delete a cookie with this method,
   the cookie file is deleted, but a dead reference to this cookie is
   remained in the cookies index file. (index.dat)
2. Destroy Cookies Files: When you destroy a cookie:
   * The cookie file is filled with null characters, in order to
     prevent the restoring of the file in the future.
   * The cookie file is deleted.
   * The reference to the deleted cookie file in the cookies index
     file is filled with null characters.


In most cases, you should use the first method to the delete your
cookies. However, if you want to completely remove all traces of your
cookies, you should carefully use the second method (destroy cookies).
Before using the "destroy" option, you must close all windows of Internet
Explorer, and then refresh the cookies list (F5) in order to get the
latest snapshot of the cookies in your system.
