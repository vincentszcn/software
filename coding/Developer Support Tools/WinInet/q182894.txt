The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Explorer (Programming), versions 4.0, 4.01
---------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you follow the instructions in DbgWinInet.txt from the Platform SDK to
trace the WinInet calls that Internet Explorer 4.x makes, there is a good
chance that a log file will not be generated.

CAUSE
=====

By default Internet Explorer 4.x runs all instances of the browser within a
single process. If you have the Active Desktop enabled then that process
was started when you logged on. Therefore if you start up a command prompt
and set the environment variable wininetlog=1, it will have no impact on
the Internet Explorer process that is already running. Therefore, the
WinInet log will not be generated.

RESOLUTION
==========

Probably the easiest and best way to get around this problem is to set the
Internet Explorer advanced option that allows you to browse in a new
process. To set this option, click Internet Options from the View menu and
click the Advanced tab. Under the Browsing section, check the "Browse in a
new process" option.

Now you can follow the steps in DbgWinInet.txt to set the wininetlog=1
environment variable and launch Iexplore.exe from the same command prompt
to cause the log to be generated. Remember that Internet Explorer will
create the log file in your desktop directory by default.

STATUS
======

This is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DbgWinInet.txt is in the Platform SDK and can be found with the debug
version of Wininet.dll in the /Mssdk/Bin/Debug/Wininet directory.
