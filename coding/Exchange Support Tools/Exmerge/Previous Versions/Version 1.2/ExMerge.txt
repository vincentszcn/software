***************************************************************
Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Merge Program, v1.1
Developed by: Kali Buhariwalla, Microsoft Technical Support
***************************************************************

The Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Merge Program is a program that will 
allow a Microsoft Exchange Administrator to extract data from mailboxes
on a Microsoft Exchange Server and then merge this data into the same 
mailboxes on another Microsoft Exchange Server.

The program copies data from the source server into Personal Folders 
(.PST files) and then merges the data, in the Personal Folders, into 
the mailboxes on the destination server.

The program has two modes of operation: One Step and Two Step.
In the One Step mode, the program will copy data from the source mailbox
to a .PST file and then merge the data in the .PST file into the same
mailbox on the destination server. In this case, the mailbox on the 
destination server must have the same mailbox name as well the same
container path. The Distinguished Name(DN) of the mailbox on the destination
server is obtained by replacing the Organization and Site names in the
the DN of the mailbox on the source server with the Organization and
Sites names of the destination server.

In the Two Step mode, the user has the option of only copying data to 
.PST files or merging data from .PST files into a server.

In order for this program to successfully work, the user must be logged
into Windows NT with the Microsoft Exchange Service Account. If this is
not possible, then the current Windows NT account must have permissions
on all mailboxes selected to be merged.

The program creates a log file called C:\EXMERGE.LOG containing any
errors encountered during operation.

LIMITATIONS
===========
This version of the program will only merge user folders and messages. 
It does not support Inbox Rules, forms and Schedule+ data. This program
will merge Outlook Calendars and Contacts.

Messages copied will lose their single instance storage and this may 
result in the size of the Microsoft Exchange Private Information Storage 
increasing significantly.

USING EXMERGE WHEN THE INFORMATION STORE WON'T START
====================================================
Assume the production server is called SERVERP and another test
server is called SERVERT

1) Create a new (blank) Information Store on SERVERP, by moving
   out all the files in the EXCHSRVR\MDBDATA directory. This will 
   allow the Information Store service to start.
2) Restore/Recover the old information store onto SERVERT.
3) Stop the Information Store service on SERVERP.
4) Stop the Information Store service on SERVERT.
5) On SERVERT, rename the EXCHSRVR\MDBDATA directory to MDBDATA.OLD
6) On SERVERT create a new directory called EXCHSRVR\MDBDATA.
7) On SERVERP, rename the EXCHSRVR\MDBDATA directory to MDBDATA.NEW
8) On SERVERP create a new directory called EXCHSRVR\MDBDATA.
9) On SERVERP, from the EXCHSRVR\MDBDATA.NEW directory copy the PRIV.EDB
   and the PUB.EDB files to the EXCHSRVR\MDBDATA directory on SERVERT.
10) On SERVERT, from the EXCHSRVR\MDBDATA.OLD directory copy the PRIV.EDB
   and the PUB.EDB files to the EXCHSRVR\MDBDATA directory on SERVERP.
   Hence we have swapped the PRIV.EDB and PUB.EDB files on the two servers.
11) On SERVERP, run ISINTEG -patch
12) On SERVERT, run ISINTEG -patch.
13) Run the ExMerge program to now merge all data from SERVERT into SERVERP.
 

KNOWN ISSUES
============
Problems getting mailboxes on a server.
--------------------------------------------------------
1) Check server name
2) Check organization and site names.
3) Verify that the DS and IS are running on the server. The program gets 
   the list of mailboxes from the IS, since it also gets the mailbox size.
4) Sometimes the list displayed may not contain all the mailboxes on the Exchange 
   server. Mailboxes that have never been logged into, have no Information
   store object and hence these mailboxes are not detected. This behaviour
   is also noticed in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program when 
   viewing the Mailbox Resources of the Private Information Store. The
   workaround to this problem is to log into the Microsoft Exchange client
   and send an e-mail message to all mailboxes on that server. This will
   create mailbox objects in the IS for all mailboxes.

 Error configuring message service (MSEMS)
----------------------------------------------------------------
This error may be reported in the ExMerge.log.
This error could be generated if there is no Directory object for mailbox object that exists in the Information Store. Check the Mailbox Resources page of the Private Information Store, in the Admin program and then verify that Directory Objects exists for the mailboxes listed in the Mailbox Resources.
Directory objects can be created manually, or by using the DS/IS adjustment. 
Please make sure you understand the implications of running the DS/IS adjustment BEFORE running it.

Error opening message store (MSEMS). Verify you have the correct permissions to log on
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make sure that you are logged into Windows NT with an account that has rights to the mailboxes you are
trying to access using ExMerge.exe
It may be easiest to log into Windows NT, using the Microsoft Exchange Service Account.
